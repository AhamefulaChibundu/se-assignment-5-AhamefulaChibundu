HOW TO INSTALL PYTHON ON WINDOWS

Here is how I installed python on my computer. If you follow the steps below, 
you can successfully install python on your computer also. The steps are as follows:

    1. Visit www.python.org and then download the latest version. 
    The latest version when I downloaded mine was python3.12.3. 
    2. The next step is to click on download
    3. After the download is complete, double click on the downloaded file
    Click The add path checkbox so that the python path can be set automatically,
    then click on install now. After installation you would see a page saying
    "setup was successfull"
    4.Finally, you have to confirm if your python was successfully
     installed by going to “start”, search and click on cmd which is your command
     line. Once it opens, type the command“python--version” and the version of 
     the python you installed would be displayed.
